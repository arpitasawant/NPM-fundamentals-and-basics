mkdir npm_basics

cd npm_basics

Install lodash module:
npm install lodash

ls

cd node_modules

****How Does NPM install module?****

npm view lodash

-> The command is going to spit a tar file url that is the tarball URL.
This is the tar file only thing npm receives from the developer.
https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash/-/lodash-4.17.21.tgz

tar -xvzf lodash-4.17.21.tar.gz

-> Unzip the tar file

****package.json****

npm init

-> npm initization with package.json

rm package.json

-> removing the file

npm init -y

-> -y flag (short for yes) will directly initialize the npm.

cat package.json
->

*****************************

Semantic Versioning: It has some guidelines to version your package and
we have to follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

*****************************

package-lock.json

nano package.json
->We can edit our file using nano

^caret:
It changes major,minor and patch to latest

~tilde:
It keeps major and minor numbers same and update the patch to latest one

*****************************

Dependencies

devDependencies:

npm install webpack --save-dev
-> If we want to install development tool instead of installing it in 
production environment we can use this command which will create devDependencies.
